### Cormac Sugrue

I’m a photographer working primarily with portraits, street, and landscapes, with a documentary approach. My work focuses on noticing small shifts in light, mood, and everyday life.

I’m interested in the ordinary, small gestures, quiet light, familiar environments, and how something subtle can feel meaningful if you slow down and look. I prefer moments that feel unplanned and honest rather than constructed.

A lot of my work comes from walking, travelling, and observing rather than setting things up. This portfolio is a collection of images that felt simple, genuine, and worth holding onto.
